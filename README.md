**Disdungeon** is a game made for the [Geleia Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/geleiajam) organized by [Fellowship of the Game](https://fog-icmc.itch.io/) on **ICMC USP São Carlos**.

The theme was: **"Villains also matter"**.

Also, some additional goals were provided, this game tried to achieve:

- **Monochromatic  (The game should only use tones of the same color):** Each game screen uses only 2 shades of the same color.

- **Accessible:** The game was designed to be acessible for people with daltonism, the colors used where picked from a table of colors that are more easily differentiable for the various types of daltonism. Also, colors are not necessary to understand the game. For research about the colors to use and for checking the accessibility  provided by the colors used the following source was consulted: https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/.

- **Inclusion of female characters:** The game has a female character.
